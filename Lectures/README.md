The first thing that happens is a http request when you enter a website URL. 
opening page should be called index.html
The web is made up of computers that we call clients and servers.

Clients are the computers and other internet-connected devices that use the internet.
Servers are computers that store web pages or applications. They are computers, just like the machine you are on right now, but typically without the keyboard, trackpad, or screen.
